//            Checker for two output vs another two
// As we need to verify that the structural
// outputs agree with those of the behavioral ones in different parts of
// the project, a file is printed which will be included in all the testers
// that require it.

//CHECKER

    input  out_b0,
    input  out_b1,

// If we compare out0 from each module and it doesn't match at the same time
// the test result is that the both file don't match
