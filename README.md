> `PCI -> Peripheral Component Interconnect`
> `PHY -> Physical Layer`

> `PCIe-PHY` refers to the `Physical Layer` of the `PCI Express (PCIe)` interface, which is responsible for transmitting and receiving data over physical media like copper traces or cables. It performs key functions such as `serialization/deserialization (SerDes)`, `clock and data recovery`, `signal equalization`, and `electrical signaling`, ensuring high-speed and reliable communication between hardware components like CPUs, GPUs, and SSDs. As the foundational layer in the PCIe stack, the `PHY` is essential for maintaining signal integrity and supporting the high data rates that PCIe enables.
